# Data-Type-Converter
A project that converts integers and floating point numbers to hexadecimal representations within Systems Programming course.

## How It Works
Program reads integer and floating point numbers seperated with new line characters from input.txt. Integers converts to 2's complement bit representation, unsigned integers converts to unsigned integer bit representation and the floating point numbers converts to IEEE-like format. Program reformats bit representations to hexadecimal representations. Program asks user byter ordering (little or big endian) and floating point size via keyboard.The output creates at output.txt.
